0.3.1
=====

Changes since 0.3.0:

- Update license from LGPL 2.0 to 2.1
- Implement a "relaxed mode" so that we can match more media (while not being
  strictly conformant to the DLNA spec.)
- Modify several audio and video profiles to allow for relaxed matching
- Implement support for "extended profiles" so that we can add custom profiles
  for popular formats no supported but the DLNA spec.
- Add extended and relaxed modes to gupnp-dlna-info and gupnp-dlna-ls-profiles
- Minor fixes and profile updates
