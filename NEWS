Changes since 0.1:

- Add support for a few more AVC profiles
- Update in-tree copy of gst-convenience
- Make MP4 matching stricter - only ISO-compliant files are matched
- Couple of enhancements to simplify writing profile XML
- Add an API for getting a encoding profile for a DLNA profile and an example

  work-in-progress.
