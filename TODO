* More about extending tools - gupnp-dlna-info-2.0 could show DLNA
  profiles restrictions and discovered metadata attributes.
  gupnp-dlna-ls-profiles-2.0 could show restrictions of listed DLNA
  profiles.

* Write a GStreamer-only utility for creating a GstEncodingProfile
  from GUPnPDLNAProfile. That could be easily done when above points
  are done.

* Bring the tests back to life. And make them being run on make check.

* Don't export all functions out there. There should be some linker
  flag that either takes a regexp for functions to export or takes a
  file listing them. Otherwise using G_GNUC_INTERNAL for every
  function not to be exported will be tedious.

* Read TODO.old for some ideas.

* Add a gupnp-dlna-metadata.h main headers. Maybe make the single include
  headers the only includable ones.
